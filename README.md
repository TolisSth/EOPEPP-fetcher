# EOPEPP Fetcher 
EOPEPP is the National Organization for Certification of Qualifications & Vocational Guidance of the Hellenic Republic and this is a tool that helps getting the announcements of exams from the organization's page. 

# Motivation 
As a software technician I am currently awaiting for the announcement of my exams to get my EU degree and ofcourse I am bored of navigating to the website and checking so I made this small script. 

# Requirements 
Computer (optionally a quantum one).
